<div class="verse indent1">Loving in trueth, and fayne my love in verse to show,</div>
<div class="verse">That the deere <em>Shee</em>, might take some pleasure of my paine:</div>
<div class="verse">Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,</div>
<div class="verse">Knowledge might pittie winne, and pittie grace obtaine.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I sought fit wordes to paint the blackest face of woe,</div>
<div class="verse">Studying inventions fine, her wittes to entertaine,</div>
<div class="verse">Oft turning others leaves, to see if thence would flowe,</div>
<div class="verse">Some fresh and fruitfull showre, upon my Sunne-burnt braine.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">But wordes came halting out, wanting inventions stay,</div>
<div class="verse">Invention Natures childe, fledde Stepdame studies blowes:</div>
<div class="verse">And others feete, still seem’de but strangers in my way,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus great with Childe to speake, and helplesse in my throwes,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Byting my trewand penne, beating my selfe for spite:</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Foole saide my Muse to mee, looke in thy heart and write.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Not at first sight, nor with a dribbing shot,</div>
<div class="verse">Love gave the wound, which while I breath will bleede:</div>
<div class="verse">But knowne, worth did in mine of time proceede,</div>
<div class="verse">Till by degrees it had full conquest got.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I sawe and lik’d, I lik’d but loved not,</div>
<div class="verse">I lov’d, but did not straight what Love decreede:</div>
<div class="verse">At length to Loves decrees, I forst agreede:</div>
<div class="verse">Yet with repining at so partiall lot.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Now even that foot-steppe of lost libertie</div>
<div class="verse">Is gone, and now like slave borne Muscovite:</div>
<div class="verse">I call it praise to suffer tyrannie,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And now imploy the remnant of my wit</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To make my selfe believe that all is well,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">While with a feeling skill I paint my hell.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Let Daintie wittes cry on the Sisters nine,</div>
<div class="verse">That bravely maskt, their fancies may be tolde:</div>
<div class="verse">Or Pinders Apes flaunt they in phrases fine,</div>
<div class="verse">Enamling with pyde flowers their thoughts of gold:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Or els let them in statelyee glorie shine,</div>
<div class="verse">Ennobling new found tropes with problemes old:</div>
<div class="verse">Or with strange similes, inricht each line,</div>
<div class="verse">Of hearbes or beasts, which <em>Inde</em> or <em>Affricke</em> hold.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For me in sooth, no Muse but one I know,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Phrases and Problemes from my reach do growe.</div>
<div class="verse">And straunge things cost too deere for my poor sprites,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">How then? even thus in <em>Stellas</em> face I reede,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">What love and beautie be, then all my deede</div>
<div class="verse">But coppying is, what in her nature writes.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Vertue (alas) now let me take some rest,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou set’st a bate betweene my will and wit;</div>
<div class="verse">If vaine love have my simple soule opprest,</div>
<div class="verse">Leave what thou lik’st not, deale not thou with it.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Thy Scepter use in some olde <em>Catoes</em> brest,</div>
<div class="verse">Churches or Schooles are for thy seat more fit:</div>
<div class="verse">I doe confes, (pardon a fault confest,)</div>
<div class="verse">My mouth too tender is for thy hard bit.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But if that needes, thou wilt usurping bee</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The little reason that is left in mee.</div>
<div class="verse">And still th’ effect of thy perswasions proove,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I sweare, my heart such one shall shew to thee,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">That shrines in flesh so true a deitie,</div>
<div class="verse">That Vertue, thou thy selfe shalt be in love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">It is most true, that eyes are found to serve</div>
<div class="verse">The inward light: and that the heavenly part</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Ought to be King, from whose rules who doth swerve,</div>
<div class="verse">Rebels to nature, strive for their owne smart.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">It is most true, what wee call <em>Cupids</em> dart,</div>
<div class="verse">An Image is, which for ourselves we carve:</div>
<div class="verse">And fooles adore, in Temple of our hart,</div>
<div class="verse">Till that good God make church and Church-men starve.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">True that true beautie vertue is in deede,</div>
<div class="verse">Whereof this beautie can but be a shade:</div>
<div class="verse">Which Elements with mortall mixture breede,</div>
<div class="verse">True that on earth we are but Pilgrimes made,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">And should in soule, up to our Country move:</div>
<div class="verse indent3">True and most true, that I must <em>Stella</em> love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Some Lovers speake, when they their Muses entertaine</div>
<div class="verse">Of hopes begot, by feare, of wot not what desires,</div>
<div class="verse">Of force of heavenly beames, infusing hellish paine;</div>
<div class="verse">Of lyving deathes, deere woundes, faire Stormes, and friesing fyres.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Some one his songs in <em>Jove</em> and <em>Joves</em> straunge tales attyres,</div>
<div class="verse">Bordered with Bulles and Swannes, poudered with golden raine:</div>
<div class="verse">Another humbler witte to shepheards pipe retyres,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet hiding royall blood, full oft in Rurall vaine.</div>
<div class="verse indent3">To some a sweetest plaint a sweetest stile affordes,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Whiles teares poure out his inke, and sighes breathe</div>
<div class="verse">His paper pale despaire, and paine his penne doth move.</div>
<div class="verse indent3">I can speake what I feele, and feele as much as they,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">But thinke that all the mappe of my state I display,</div>
<div class="verse">When trembling voice brings foorth, that I do <em>Stella</em> love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">When nature made her chiefe worke, <em>Stella’s</em> eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">In collour blacke, why wrapt she beames so bright?</div>
<div class="verse">Would she in beamy blacke like Painter wise,</div>
<div class="verse">Frame daintiest lustre mixte of shades of light?</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Or did she els that sober hewe devise,</div>
<div class="verse">In object best, to strength and knitt our sighte</div>
<div class="verse">Least if no vaile these brave gleames did disguise,</div>
<div class="verse">They Sun-like should more dazell than delight.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<div class="verse indent1">Or would she her miraculous power shewe,</div>
<div class="verse">That whereas blacke seemes Beauties contrarie,</div>
<div class="verse">Shee even in blacke doth make all Beauties flower</div>
<div class="verse">Both so and thus; she minding Love should bee</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Plaste ever there, gave him this mourning weede:</div>
<div class="verse indent3">To honour all their deathes, which for her bleede.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Love borne in <em>Greece</em>, of late fled from his native place,</div>
<div class="verse">Forst by a tedious proofe, that Turkish hardned hart</div>
<div class="verse">Were no fit marke, to pearce with his fine pointed dart:</div>
<div class="verse">And pleasd with our lost peace, staide here his fleeting race.</div>
<div class="verse">But finding these North climes, too coldlie him imbrace,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Not usde to frosen clippes, he strave to finde some part</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Where with most ease and warmth, he might imploy his art.</div>
<div class="verse">At length he preach’d himselfe in <em>Stellas</em> joyfull face,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose faire skinne, beamie eyes, like morning Sunne on snow:</div>
<div class="verse">Deceiv’d the quaking boy, who thought from so pure light,</div>
<div class="verse">Effects of livelie heate must needes in nature growe.</div>
<div class="verse">But shee most faire, most colde; made him thence take his flight</div>
<div class="verse indent3">To my close hart; where while some fire brands he did lay,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">He burnt unwares his wings, and cannot fly away.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Queene Vertues Court, which some call <em>Stellas</em> face,</div>
<div class="verse">Prepar’d by Natures cheefest furniture:</div>
<div class="verse">Hath his front built of Alabaster pure.</div>
<div class="verse">Gold is the covering of that statelie place.</div>
<div class="verse">The doore, by which sometimes comes forth her grace</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Red Porphire is, which locke of Pearle makes sure:</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Whose Porches rich, with name of chekes indure,</div>
<div class="verse">Marble mixt red and white, doe enterlace.</div>
<div class="verse">The Windowes now, through which this heavenly guest</div>
<div class="verse">Lookes ore the world, and can finde nothing such,</div>
<div class="verse">Which dare claime from those lights the name of best,</div>
<div class="verse">Of touch they are, that without touch doe touch,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Which Cupids selfe, from beauties mine did drawe:</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Of touch they are, and poore I am their strawe.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Reason, in faith thou art well serv’d, that still</div>
<div class="verse">Would’st brabling be, with sence and love in me:</div>
<div class="verse">I rather with thee climbe the Muses hill,</div>
<div class="verse">Or reach the fruite of Natures chiefest tree:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Or seeke heavens course, or heavens inside to see:</div>
<div class="verse">Why should’st thou toyle, our thornie soyle to till?</div>
<div class="verse">Leave sence and those that sences objects be,</div>
<div class="verse">Deale thou with powers, of thoughts leave love to will.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">But thou wouldst needes fight both with Love and sence,</div>
<div class="verse">With sworde of witte, giving woundes of dispraise:</div>
<div class="verse">Till down-right blowes did foyle thy cunning fence,</div>
<div class="verse">So soone as they strake thee with <em>Stellas</em> rayes.</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Reason, thou knewest, and offered straight to prove;</div>
<div class="verse indent3">By reason good, good reason her to love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In truth oh Love: with what a boyish kinde</div>
<div class="verse">Thou doost proceede, in thy most serious waies;</div>
<div class="verse">That when the heaven to thee his best displaies,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet of that best thou leav’st the best behinde.</div>
<div class="verse">That like a Childe that some faire booke doth finde</div>
<div class="verse indent3">With gilden leaves of colloured Velom, playes</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Or at the most on some faire picture stares,</div>
<div class="verse">But never heedes the fruite of Writers minde.</div>
<div class="verse">So when thou sawest in Natures cabinet,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Stella</em>, thou straight lokest babies in her eyes:</div>
<div class="verse">In her chekes pit, thou didst thy pitfall set,</div>
<div class="verse">And in her brest bo-peepe or touching lyes,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Playing and shining in each outward part:</div>

<div class="verse">That her sweet breath makes all thy flames t’arise,</div>

<div class="verse indent1">That her grace gracious makes thy wrongs, that shee,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<div class="verse indent1">What word so ere shee speakes, perswades for thee:</div>
<div class="verse">That her cleere voice, lifts thy fame to the skyes.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Thou countest <em>Stella</em> thine, like those whose powres</div>
<div class="verse">Having got up a breach; (by fighting well)</div>
<div class="verse">Cry victorie, this faire day all is ours:</div>
<div class="verse">Oh no, her heart is such a Cytadell.</div>
<div class="verse indent3">So fortified with wit, stor’d with disdaine:</div>
<div class="verse indent3">That to winne it, is all the skill and paine.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><em>Phœbus</em> was Judge, betweene <em>Jove</em>, <em>Mars,</em> &amp; love,</div>

<div class="verse indent1">But in verde fielde, <em>Mars</em> bare a golden Speare,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Which through a bleeding heart, his point did shove:</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Each had his Crest, <em>Mars</em> carried <em>Venus</em> glove.</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Jove</em> on his Helme the Thunderbolt did reare.</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Cupid</em> then smiles, for on his crest there lyes</div>

<div class="verse indent3">Where Roses gueules, are borne in silver fielde.</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Phœbus</em> drewe wide the Curtaine of the skyes</div>
<div class="verse indent3">To blase the last, and swore devoutly then:</div>

Produced by Bryan Ness and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This book was
produced from scanned images of public domain material
from the Google Books project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
